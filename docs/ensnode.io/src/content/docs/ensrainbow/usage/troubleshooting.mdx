This page aggregates the most common issues users run into when operating ENSRainbow.

## Common Startup Errors

### "Database schema mismatch"
**Cause**: Your on-disk database was created with a newer/older schema than this binary understands.
**Fix**: Upgrade ENSRainbow to the latest version *or* download a matching database archive.

### "Label set id mismatch"
**Cause**: You attempted to ingest a `.ensrainbow` file whose `LABEL_SET_ID` differs from the database.
**Fix**: Create a fresh data directory or ensure you ingest files that share the same label-set id.

### Port already in use
Check that no other service is bound to `3223` (the default port). You can change the port via the `PORT` env-var.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use ENSRainbow without running my own server?
Yes. NameHash Labs operates a free instance at `https://api.ensrainbow.io`.

### How often are new labels added?
New label-set versions are generated on an ad-hoc basis. Watch the **Releases** page on GitHub or query `/v1/version`.

### Does ENSRainbow normalise labels?
No. It returns labels exactly as stored. Your client should perform ENS Normalisation if required.
