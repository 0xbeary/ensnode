## TODO

- Possibly add an entity relationships diagram, but ideally generated from the schema so it auto updates when the schema changes
- Explain how we inherit data model from the subgraph but i dont think this is optimal. @lightwalker was mentioning this.
- Explain what entities exist, i don't really know this well at all so research first.
- Handlers and their relationship between entities (general indexing)
- There's no schema evolution with ponder, you just start fresh every time. this is quite quirky and should be documented here.
