ENSNode uses a plugin-based architecture to support different data sources and chains. This section documents the available plugins and their implementation details.

## Available Plugins

- [Subgraph Plugin](/technical-reference/plugins/subgraph)
- [Base Names Plugin](/technical-reference/plugins/base-names)
- [Linea Names Plugin](/technical-reference/plugins/linea-names)
- [3DNS Plugin](/technical-reference/plugins/3dns)

## TODO

- Anatomy of a plugin (so handlers have namespaced handlers, relationship between data sources etc)
- How plugins are loaded/configured (via env vars)
- Maybe some dev docs around writing handlers. This was the questions i had and still kind of have around handlers in development and maybe this should wait until i do the handler story i was going to pick up.
- Data sources and their relationship to plugins (plugin can have many data sources etc). may need separate page for this?
