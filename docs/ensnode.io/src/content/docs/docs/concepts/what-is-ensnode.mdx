### What is ENSNode

ENSNode is a group of applications that work together to provide an easy way to access data for ENS and in future ENSv2. The main function is 'indexing' across multiple blockchains. In simple terms, this means it collects, processes, and organizes all the information related to ENS names (like who owns a name, what it resolves to, and other settings) from various blockchain networks. This makes the complex world of ENS data much simpler to search and use for developers and their applications.

It is comprised of three main components:

- ENSIndexer is the multichain indexer for ENS and ENSv2. It is built on [Ponder](https://ponder.sh/) and provides enhanced capabilities over the ENS Subgraph, as well as being more efficient, flexible, and maintainable. ENSNode's enhanced capabilities include multichain and multiregistrar indexing while maintaining backwards compatibility with existing ENS Subgraph APIs.
- ENSRainbow is a labelhash resolver that resolves ENS and ENSv2 names off-chain.
- ENSAdmin is a web interface that allows you to manage and monitor hosted ENSNode instances.

If you are a developer looking to access ENS data with ENSNode from the hosted API you will be using the API in ENSIndexer of which there is a hosted instance. We recommend starting with the [ENSNode Quickstart](/ensnode/quickstart/).

### ENSNode Version 1

ENSNode version 1 (`V1`), discussed here, prioritizes equivalency with the [ENS Subgraph](/ensnode/understanding/the-ens-subgraph/), which drove many architectural decisions.

## Core Design Principles

1. **Full Backwards Compatibility w/ ENS Subgraph**

   - Full support for existing ENS Subgraph queries used by [`ensjs`](https://github.com/ensdomains/ensjs/) and [`ens-app-v3`](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-app-v3)
   - Drop-in replacement for applications using the ENS Subgraph
   - Verified compatibility through extensive testing with [`ens-test-env`](https://github.com/namehash/ens-test-env/) and [ens-subgraph-transition-tools](https://github.com/namehash/ens-subgraph-transition-tools) (see [Subgraph Compatibility](/reference/subgraph-compatibility))

2. **Multi-Registry Plugin Architecture**

   - Support for indexing ENS data across multiple chains & subregistries (i.e. mainnet, Base, Linea)
   - Plugins can be activated independently or in combination

3. **Built on Ponder**

   - Improved indexing speed (>10x faster than ENS Subgraph)
   - Isolated indexing schemas (supporting branches, staging environments)
   - Access your indexed data directly from Postgres
   - `@ponder/client` for efficent client-side live queries

4. **Self-hostable Decentralization Approach**
   - Self-hostable infrastructure
   - Bring-your-own Postgres
   - Bring-your-own ENSRainbow

## @namehash/ens-deployments

This package provides configurations for each known "ENS deployment". An ENS deployment represents a single, unified namespace of ENS names with a distinct onchain root Registry and the capability to span across multiple chains, subregistries, and offchain resources.

Each deployment is independent - for instance, the Sepolia and Holesky testnet deployments are separate from the canonical mainnet deployment. This package centralizes the contract addresses, start blocks, and other configuration needed to interact with each deployment.

ENSIndexer uses `@namehash/ens-deployments` to configure its plugins and determine which are available for a given target deployment.

See the [`@namehash/ens-deployments` README](https://github.com/namehash/ensnode/blob/main/packages/ens-deployments/README.md) for more context on this package & its responsibilities.
